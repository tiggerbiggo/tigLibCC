# tigLibCC
A datapack of programs and functions for use in my Computercraft projects


##tig.inv

A wrapper for injecting custom behaviours onto peripherals and giving more ways to .

Matches based on the peripheral's type, and pulls in required functions for that peripheral type from `tig.peripherals.*`

Functions are wrapped in a way that avoids the use of : syntax, meaning they behave like ordinary functions.

##tig.files

Wraps some more common serialization / unserialization tasks, as well as quick access to the files generated by `tig_inv_setup` and `tig_group_setup`

##tig.tasks

A coroutine manager based on `parallel`, designed mainly to work with `tig.gui`. It's main function is to allow addition of new tasks to the thread queue, and remove any that are dead. 
**Does not guarantee thread call order**

##tig.gui

A very simplistic GUI library built on a draw offset hierarchy, with support for yielding within click event listeners through `tig.tasks`. Currently only supports monitors and basic click events.
